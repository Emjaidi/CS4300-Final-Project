<h1>Here is a little bit about me:</h1>
<p>I enjoy spending my evenings reading. Recently, I have been reading a romance novel ( a 
recommendation from a friend) called 'Book Lovers' by an author named Emily Henry. I usually don't 
read romance books; I like to think that my taste in literature is eclectic. The book I read before this one 
was part ghost story, part historical fiction, and part sci-fi! I enjoy fiction books that do not conform to 
any one genre or trope. I also enjoy reading biographies. I think reading biographies helped me realize 
that no matter the situation one currently is, that there is always a part of the story not yet lived, and 
sometimes knowing the story of someone's life helps me live mine because they have lived through their 
mistakes and in a way, they are teaching me a lesson. One biography that has impacted me is called ‘M 
Train’ by Patti Smith. She is a poet, musician, and storyteller. After reading her biography it inspired me 
to write and read more. One other biography I was influenced by was <a href = 
"https://app.thestorygraph.com/books/f4057647-c4ea-4dd6-8166-039cb34ec9bc">Jaron Lainier’s ‘The 
Dawn of the New Everything’</a>. In the book, he reflects on his journey through his life from a boy 
who has lost his mother to a pioneer in the virtual reality industry. </p>
